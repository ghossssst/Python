  Reaction Time Test:
  
    Using the parts provided with day 3, I have created a simple reaction time test.
    The program will count down from 5, then wait a random number of seconds between
    0 and 10 to turn the red light on. The user must then hit the button as soon as
    they can after the light changes.

  
# Day 4

  Lockpick Game:
  
    Using the parts provided with day 4, I have created a Lockpick game.
    The player must rotate the potentiometer till the light turns on and
    then wait a small amount of time. After this the the game will move 
    onto the next light and the task is repeated.
